# General A.I. Challenge - Round 1 - My submission
This is my prize winning submission for GoodAI's [General A.I. Challenge](https://www.general-ai-challenge.org/) (Round 1: Gradual Learning). 

You can read more about it in [General A.I. Challenge - Gradual Learning Results](https://www.general-ai-challenge.org/gradual-learning)
You may also check the [specifications](https://mirror.general-ai-challenge.org/data/Specification_doc.pdf) or the [whitepaper](https://mirror.general-ai-challenge.org/data/andresdelcamponovales_whitepaper.pdf) submitted to the challenge outlining the instructions for compiling and running the agent, as well as its high-level design. 

Note that this project uses [NetMQ](https://github.com/zeromq/netmq/blob/master/README.md) to communicate to the AI environment.

The code is uploaded AS IT WAS delivered to the challenge. 
Note that due to time constraints and due to the prototyping nature of the challenge, the code is not necessarily as clean as I would have liked it to be.
