# General A.I. Challenge - Round 1 - My submission
This is my (Andr√©s del Campo Novales) prize winning submission for GoodAI's [General A.I. Challenge](https://www.general-ai-challenge.org/) (Round 1: Gradual Learning). 

You can read more about it in [General A.I. Challenge - Gradual Learning Results](https://www.general-ai-challenge.org/gradual-learning)
You may also check the [specifications](https://mirror.general-ai-challenge.org/data/Specification_doc.pdf) or the [whitepaper](https://mirror.general-ai-challenge.org/data/andresdelcamponovales_whitepaper.pdf) submitted to the challenge outlining the instructions for compiling and running the agent, as well as its high-level design. 

Note that this project uses [NetMQ](https://github.com/zeromq/netmq/blob/master/README.md) to communicate to the AI environment.

The code in the [Source folder](https://github.com/andresdelcampo/aichallenge1/tree/master/Source) is uploaded AS IT WAS delivered to the challenge with the exception of adding license and cleaning up the solution of extra files. It was developed in C# under Windows. Note that due to time constraints and due to the prototyping nature of the challenge, the code is not necessarily as clean as I would have liked it to be.

You can also find an agent already compiled in Learner.zip, which can be tested using the [Environment Instructions](https://github.com/general-ai-challenge) against the training task set included -or any evaluation set created separately.
